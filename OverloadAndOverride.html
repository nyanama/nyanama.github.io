<h1>Difference Between Method Overloading and Overriding</h1>

<h3>Differences</h3>

<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Overloading</th>
<th>Overriding</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><p> Creating the multiple methods in a class with same name and different signature.</p></td>
<td><p> Creating a method in parent and child class with same name and signature.</p></td>

<td><p> Method names and arguments should be the same.</p></td>

<tr>
<td><p> Return type can be different (we can change the return type).</p></td>
<td><p> Return type can be same or a co variant (we can not have different return type exept co varian).</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><p> It increases the redability of the code.</p></td>
<td><p> To override the existing implementation of the parent class.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><p> Binds the appropriate methods at comiletime.</p></td>
<td><p> Binds the appropriate methods at runtime.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><p> Static methods can be overloaded, as this is compile time binding (static methods also binds at compiletime).</p></td>
<td><p> Can not override static methods as overriding is runtime and static methods are at compiletime.</p></td>

<h4>Questions</h4>

<p>What is the output?</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
public class OverloadingExample {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
    	OverloadingExample test = new OverloadingExample();
		System.out.println(test.methodOne(null));
	}
	public String methodOne(String str) {
		return "String";
	}
	public String methodOne(Object str) {
		return "Object";
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p style="color:red">	Answwer is "String" <br>
	Reason: If more than one method is applicable and accesable to a method innvocation then comilar will give preference to subclass arguments.
	Here object is super class and String is sub class so sub class argument method called and returned String. </p>

<p>What is the output?</p>

    	OverloadingExample test = new OverloadingExample();
		System.out.println(test.methodOne(null));
	}
	public String methodOne(String str) {

	}
	public String methodOne(Object str) {
		return "Object";
	}
	public String methodOne(Integer str) {
		return "Object";
	}

}
</code></pre>
	<p style="color:red">Answwer is - Compile time error - The method methodOne(String) is ambiguous for the type Test <br>
	Reason: As we discussed if multiple methods are eligible to access a method call it will give preference to the method with sub class arguments 
	but here we have two methods with sub class arguments String and Integer. So compiler can not decide which method to invoke and gives an error.</p>

	<p>What is co-variant method overriding?</p>
	<p style="color:red">Before Java 1.5 we have a hard rule saying that for method overriding the return type should be same for parent and child class methods.
	But from 1.5 the restriction is relaxed. Now we can have same return type or subclass of the return type of parent class.</p>
