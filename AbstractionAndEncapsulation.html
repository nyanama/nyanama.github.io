<h1>Difference Between Abstraction and Encapsulation</h1>

<p>
Before going to the differences, first we will understand what is Abstration and what is Encapsulation
</p>
<h3>Abstraction</h3>

<p>
	The way of projecting the essential things and hidding the complex things is known as Abstarction.
	<br><br>
	In other words Abstraction is a process of hidding implementation details and showing only the functionality. 
	<br><br>
	Abstraction can be achieved by using interfaces and abstract classes.
</p>


<h3>Encapsulation</h3>

<p>
	It is a process of wrapping similar group of things into single unit.
	<br><br>
	And also it is a process of binding data and methods to hide the data using access modifiers (this is called data hidding). 
	<br><br>
	Complete encapsulation in java is achieved by making variables of a class private and access to them, outside the class, is provided only through public methods (getters and setters in this case).
